# CHATBOT-WITH-RULE-BASED-RESPONSES
The provided Python code creates a simple rule-based chatbot. It uses a dictionary to store predefined rules and responses. When a user enters a message, the code iterates through the rules, checking if the user's input matches any patterns. If a match is found, the corresponding response is provided. If no match is found, a default response is given. The chatbot continues to interact with the user until the user enters "quit."

Key Components:

chatbot_response function: Handles user input and provides responses.
rules dictionary: Stores predefined rules and responses.
Regular expressions: Used to match patterns in the user's input.
Loop: Continuously prompts the user for input and processes responses.
Overall, the code demonstrates the basic principles of creating a rule-based chatbot, including defining rules, matching patterns, and providing responses.
